# Lacco Use Cases

## Use Case 1: CPAP Therapy Optimization

### Patient
45-year-old male, moderate obstructive sleep apnea (AHI 22)

### Problem
CPAP therapy initiated (12 cmH₂O, good adherence), but patient still tired and wakes frequently. CPAP data shows good compliance, minimal leaks.

### Lacco Monitoring (2 weeks)
- Bedroom CO₂: 2100 ppm average (very high)
- HRV: 45 ms (low - stress indicator)
- Arousals: 15/night (CPAP data shows)
- Correlation: High CO₂ → HRV drops → arousal events

### Intervention
**Not done:** Increase CPAP pressure  
**Done:** Improve bedroom ventilation (open window, add fan)

### Results
- CO₂: 800 ppm (normal)
- HRV: 75 ms (improved)
- Arousals: 4/night
- Patient: "Much better sleep, feel rested"

**Outcome:** Problem solved without changing CPAP settings

## Use Case 2: Asthma Environmental Triggers

### Patient
32-year-old female, mild persistent asthma

### Problem
Frequent nighttime awakenings with breathlessness. Using rescue inhaler 3-4 times/week at night. Daytime asthma well controlled.

### Lacco Monitoring
**Week 1-2:**
- Nocturnal VOC: 1.2 ppm (elevated)
- CO₂: 1400 ppm (borderline)
- SpO₂ drops: 5 episodes/night to 94%

**Identified sources:** New paint, air freshener, scented candles

### Intervention
- Remove air freshener and scented products
- Wash new bedding
- Open window for ventilation

**Week 3-4:**
- VOC: 0.3 ppm (normal)
- CO₂: 900 ppm (normal)
- SpO₂ drops: 1 episode/week
- Rescue inhaler: 1 time/week

**Outcome:** Symptoms improved without medication change

## Summary

Lacco enables precision medicine by:
1. Distinguishing device issues from environmental issues
2. Identifying specific environmental triggers
3. Personalizing interventions
4. Avoiding unnecessary medication adjustments
